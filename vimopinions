I think vim is cool in that you can use the commands and it's almost like you have another terminal working within a terminal (idk if I am making sense haha). But I like how you have certain commands like r and ctrl u to redo and undo (among many others). I definitely think vim is very useful in that sense. But, I don't like how you can't use your up and down arrows and how you cant kust click to the next line and have to go through every line individually until you get to where you want.
